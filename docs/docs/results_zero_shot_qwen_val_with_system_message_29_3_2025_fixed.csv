"3","are two small pulmonary arterioles packed with laminated swirls of fetal squamous cells?","yes","Yes"
"4","what is acute viral hepatitis characterized by?","predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate","Acute viral hepatitis is characterized by inflammation of the liver cells (hepatocytes) caused by viruses. The liver cells may show signs of damage such as necrosis, which can lead to the release of enzymes into the bloodstream. This condition can cause symptoms like jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Treatment typically involves rest, hydration, and supportive care, depending on the specific virus causing the infection."
"5","what do the cells have?","wavy nuclei","The cells appear to have a fibroblastic appearance with elongated, branching processes.

"332","what is good example of poorly differentiated?","infiltrating ductal carcinoma","Poorly differentiated tumors often have cells that are difficult to identify as specific cell types due to their atypical morphology and lack of distinct boundaries. An example of poorly differentiated tissue might be seen in a sarcoma where the tumor cells appear to be undifferentiated, with no clear signs of muscle, nerve, or other typical cell types. This can make it challenging to diagnose the exact type of cancer and may require further analysis for accurate classification."

This can happen if the tissue is not properly rinsed or if the fixative is not applied correctly. The leakage of enzymes from the tissue can interfere with the staining process, leading to the absence of expected colors or patterns."

The presence of hemorrhage suggests that there has been significant disruption of blood supply to these organs, leading to tissue damage and subsequent bleeding."
